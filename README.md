# Machine Learning Curriculum

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence dedicated at making
machines learn from observational data without being explicitly programmed.

> Machine learning and AI are not the same. Machine learning is an instrument in
> the AI symphony — a component of AI. So what is Machine Learning — or ML —
> exactly? It’s the ability for an algorithm to learn from prior data in order
> to produce a behavior. ML is teaching machines to make decisions in situations
> they have never seen.

This curriculum is made to guide you to learn machine learning, recommend tools, and help you to embrace ML lifestyle by suggesting media to follow.
I update it regularly to maintain freshness and get rid of outdated content and deprecated tools.

## Machine Learning in General

Study this section to understand fundamental concepts and develop intuitions before going any deeper.

> A computer program is said to learn from experience `E` with respect to some
> class of tasks `T` and performance measure `P` if its performance at tasks in
> `T`, as measured by `P`, improves with experience `E`.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning where deep artificial neural
networks (DNN) — algorithms inspired by the way neurons work in the brain — find
patterns in raw data by combining multiple layers of artificial neurons. As the
layers increase, so does the neural network’s ability to learn increasingly
abstract concepts.

The simplest kind of DNN is
a [Multilayer Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron)
(MLP).

### Convolutional Neural Networks

DNNs that work with grid data like sound waveforms, images and videos better
than ordinary DNNs. They are based on the assumptions that nearby input units
are more related than the distant units. They also utilize translation
invariance. For example, given an image, it might be useful to detect the same
kind of edges everywhere on the image.
They are sometimes called **convnets** or **CNNs**.

  most articles only talk about convolution in grayscale image, but he describe
  convolution in images with color channels as well. He also talks about the
  concerns and the assumptions that convnets make. This is a great lecture!

DNNs that have states. They also understand sequences that vary in length.
They are sometimes called **RNNs**.

## Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation is a type of Transfer Learning that applies a model that was trained on source dataset to do well on a target dataset without any label on the target dataset. It's one of the technique that is practically useful in the real world when the cost of labeling target dataset is high. One of the example is to train a model on synthetic data with label and try to use it on real data without label.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Before you begin, please read this blog post to understand the motivation of searching in general: https://www.determined.ai/blog/stop-doing-iterative-model-development

Open your eyes to search-driven development. It will change you. Main benefit is that there will be no setbacks. Only progress and improvement are allowed. Imagine working and progressing everyday, instead of regressing backwards because your new solution doesn't work. This guaranteed progress is what search-driven development will do to you. Apply it to everything in optimization, not just machine learning.

My top opinionated preferences are determined, ray tune, and optuna because of parallelization (distributed tuning on many machines), flexibility (can optimize arbitrary objectives and allow dataset parameters to be tuned), library of SOTA tuning algorithms (e.g. HyperBand, BOHB, TPE, PBT, ASHA, etc), result visualization/analysis tools, and extensive documentations/tutorials.

### AutoML

Make machines learn without the tedious task of feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning
that you have to do yourself. Let the machines perform machine learning for you!

Personally if I have a tabular dataset I would try FLAML and mljar first, especially if you want to get something working fast.
If you want to try gradient boosting frameworks such as XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, etc but you don't know which one works best,
I suggest you to try AutoML first because internally it will try the gradient boosting frameworks mentioned previously.

## I am confused, too many links, where do I start?
If you are a beginner and want to get started with my suggestions, please read this issue:
[https://github.com/off99555/machine-learning-curriculum/issues/4](https://github.com/off99555/machine-learning-curriculum/issues/4)

## Disclaimer

From now on, this list is going to be compact and *opinionated* towards my own real-world ML journey and I will put only content that I think are truly beneficial for me and most people.
All the materials and tools that are not good enough (in any aspect) will be gradually removed, including:

- too difficult materials without much intuition; impractical content
- too much theory without real-world practice
- unstructured materials
- courses that I don't consider to enroll myself
- information overload content, unclear direction
- tools that are too specialized and not many people can use it in their works e.g. deepdream (because you can Google it if you want to use it in your work)
- tools that are beaten by other tools; not being state-of-the-art anymore
- commercial tools that look like it can die any time soon

**NOTE**: There is no particular rank for each link. The order in which they
appear does not convey any meaning and should not be treated differently.

## How to contribute to this list
1. Fork this [repository](https://github.com/off99555/machine-learning-curriculum), then apply your change.
2. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/off99555/machine-learning-curriculum/pull/new/master) and tag me if you want.
3. That's it. If your edition is useful, I'll merge it.

Or you can just submit a [new issue](https://github.com/off99555/machine-learning-curriculum/issues/new)
containing the resource you want me to include if you don't have time to send a pull request.

The resource you want to include should be free to study.
